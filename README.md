### ***Description***
#### This game is my 1st project in my Software Engineering course at General Assembly. It is a mind focus game that allows the user to test their vision and speed as they try to figure out the different colored block from a group of blocks. 
***

### ***Technologies Used***
* HTML (for structuring)
* CSS (for styling)
* JavaScript (for game logic and interactivity)
  * events
  * Math random (for color generation)

***

### ***Getting Started***

#### Level Progression:
- The user will start with level 1 and unlock levels 2 and 3 upon completion respectively


#### Customization (bonus): 

- The user will have the option to customize their game board. Specifically they will be able to customize:
  - ***1- Shape of Blocks***
  - ***2- Number of Blocks***
  - ***3- Color Range (difficulty)***

###### ***NOTE:*** There is a default setting for each level so in case the user does not customize, they will still be ready to go. The customization will be restricted based on the level, so the "maximum difficulty" for level 1 is ***not*** the same as "maximum difficulty" for level 2 and so on

#### Gameplay:

  - The user will have 20 games per level.
  - Level 3 will have a countdown timer for additional challenge.


##### A project repo was created and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/alqassabz/colors_game).
